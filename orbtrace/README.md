ORBTrace Development
====================

This is the development status for the ORBTrace parallel TRACE hardware. Its very unlikely you want to be here but, just in case you do, this is built using Clifford Wolfs' icestorm toolchain and currently targets a lattice iCE40HX-8K board.

It is very much work in progress. To build it perform;

```
cd src
./create
```

Information on how to integrate it with orbuculum (hint, the `-o` option) is in te main README.
