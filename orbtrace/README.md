ORBTrace Development
====================

This is the development status for the ORBTrace parallel TRACE hardware. Its very unlikely you want to be here but, just in case you do, this is built using Clifford Wolfs' icestorm toolchain and currently targets a lattice ice40-HX8K board.

It is not ready for any kind of use. It is very much work in progress.

To build it perform;

```
cd src
./create
```
